- New data science program has been much better than CS and Stats so far
- Professors generally have lots of office hours for help (whether you actually get in to those office hours is a different story)
- New DS building will be cool to see.","'- Math department could definitely be strengthened 
- Some professors in the math department are not forgiving of trivial mistakes--even when you have clearly showed that you understand the content.
- The requirements for the CS department allow absolutely no room for extra courses after having to complete the HUB as well.
- The HUB requirements don't allow STEM students to explore other interests very well. CS and Math are given very few HUB units meaning we HAVE to take classes we don't want to take just for the HUB units. We would prefer to take other electives instead.
- Because DS is a new major, BU needs to be more lenient in course substitutions if they want more people to transfer. I will be taking 3 major classes per semester until I graduate just so I can get major in DS. BU ""suggests"" taking only 2 major requirements per semester.

While often egotistical, inflexible, and gruff, every single professor I have had here has been an impeccable lecturer, as well as extremely devoted to conveying academic content optimally. Notably, Andre Switala in CAS Economics and Mark Crovella in CAS CS are fantastic at what they do and have been extremely inspiring to me. Also, I really enjoy BU’s campus. The FitRec is awesome and there are always plenty of study spaces indoors.","BU is the red-headed step child of MIT and Harvard. BU needs to stop trying to compete on their level and find it’s own defining image. BU chases prestige and “diversity” with its inauthentic marketing, and demands inordinate amounts of academic investment from each student it financially coerces. If BU would examine their population they would find that the majority of students and faculty here are American, Asian, or Eastern European, not unlike many other schools of this size and caliber. The issue lies in the fact that BU as an institution is obsessed with portraying itself as a “diverse safe-space” for all minorities. There is nothing wrong with pursuing this as a goal, in fact I believe achieving this is ideally optimal. Yet, BU does it at the expense of the aforementioned majority populations on campus. BU misses the opportunity to optimize operations and cultivate an inviting student culture for the community it serves. Furthermore, BU fails to adapt as educational institutions begin to show their age. Academia is resource-starved and dying, and high-school graduates are increasingly reluctant to pay 120000 dollars a year for a degree that won’t mean anything in 5 years. It is imperative that Boston University adapts to ensure its longevity and relevance as the path from High School to the workplace disappears. ",Yes,,,Christopher Cotti,U02268778,ctcotti@bu.edu

This seemed uncomfortable for female and minority students, and was embarrassing for me to go through.

It is deceiving to have those banners as a show of diversity when that is not exactly true. The few black students here should not be used as BU's tokens for diversity. A few black students does not prove that BU is diverse.

As a black student, it makes me feel disgusted looking at these banners and then reflecting on my own experiences here at this school. There are not many students, staff, of faculty who look like me at this school, and I refuse to used by BU as a way to show that they ""care about diversity."" The same can be said about the BU website. It is false advertising. You are drawing in black applicants to this school by falsely showing that their presence will be seen and appreciated with these banners. If you really care, then take action and show it. 

It is just very frustrating to keep giving my opinion about the climate of this school and nothing is really being done. I understand that change takes time, but BU started really becoming active in DEI in 2020 during the BLM movement, and there has been nothing done to show the students that you are using our comments and suggestions to make change. At the very least, please send out an update of what you are doing or what initiatives are coming.

Another thing, BU should be more understanding around mental health. Our generation is very affected by mental illnesses. BU doesn't really show that they care about our mental health. I see this echoed with the faculty and staff. They are really accommodating and understanding in regards to mental health. It seems as if they do not really care. I just ask that BU educate their staff more about mental health and how to approach the topic when it comes up to them. It would make my experience at this school less stressful and more enjoyable if I just could get more support from my professors. It puts a mental toll on you when your professors and advisors don't take the necessary steps to understand how their actions affect how their students feel.
