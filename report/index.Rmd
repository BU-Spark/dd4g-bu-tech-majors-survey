## Notes

In what follows, each chapter is for a different subset of questions.

The chapter on departments aggregates all responses to questions related to courses in the indicated department.

## Overview

```{r}
ddf_s %>% count(gender, race) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = gender, values_from = n) %>% 
  # rowwise() %>% 
  # mutate(Total = sum(c_across(where(is.numeric)), na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  janitor::adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col")) %>% 
  gt::gt(rowname_col = "race")
```
